### Template Configurations
Template configuration files for local development or testing are available
in `config/templates`. These files are copied into the `config` directory by
`spec/spec_helper.rb`, but the resulting YAML files are git-ignored and should
not be committed to the repository.

### Solr
A generic arclight Solr configuration is provided in `solr/conf`. This
configuration can be loaded into a local Solr instance for development or
testing by running the command `docker-compose up`. The docker configuration
will create a core called "acfa".

### Setting Up A Vite Server
1. Install `nvm` (Node Version Manager) if you do not already have it with `brew install nvm`
2. Follow the [instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#calling-nvm-use-automatically-in-a-directory-with-a-nvmrc-file) from the nvm repo to set up automatic Node version switching
3. Open a new terminal window at the repo â€” this should automatically switch you to run the `node` version specified by `.nvmrc` and download it if necessary.
4. Install yarn with `npm install --global yarn`
5. Install Javascript dependencies with `yarn install`.
6. Run the vite server `yarn start:dev` - this will handle asset imports for the app.

### Setting Up A Development Finding Aids Server
1. Install Ruby dependencies with `bundle install`. The application Gemfile indicates the required Ruby version.
2. Run the setup task, which will copy template config files and other sample data: `bundle exec rake acfa:setup:all`
3. Run the rspec suite with `bundle exec rspec` - this will set up the default template configurations
4. Run the database migrations against sqlite in development with `bundle exec rake db:migrate`
5. For running Solr, you have two options:
   1. **Option 1:** Run `docker compose up` to start the solr server and then run `bundle exec rake acfa:seed` to seed the solr server with sample data.
   2. **Option 2:** Run `bundle exec rake acfa:server` to start up solr, seed it with example data, and start rails.

### Using features that require a connection to an ArchivesSpace instance API
- For most features in this app, you don't need to worry about connecting to an ArchivesSpace instance, but some features (like refreshing an EAD) do require ArchivesSpace API access.
- Our ArchivesSpace instance only allows API access for certain whitelisted IPs.
- Our deployment server IPs are whitelisted for access, but your local development environment IP isn't.
- The easiest way to go is to install sshuttle (https://github.com/sshuttle/sshuttle) and tunnel all of your computer's TCP traffic through a server that is whitelisted.  To do this with `sshuttle`, run this command: `sshuttle -r [your uni]@[hostname of whitelisted host] 0.0.0.0/0`.  Example: `sshuttle -r abc123@example-server.cul.columbia.edu 0.0.0.0/0`
- The above command will remain in the foreground in your terminal, and will tunnel all of your traffic until you end the process (via ctrl+c).  While it's running, you can open up a second terminal window and you should be able to successfully make requests to the ArchivesSpace API (via curl, ruby, or other programs).
