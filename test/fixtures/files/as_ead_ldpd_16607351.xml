    <head>Biographical / Historical</head>
<p>Henry Pelham Burn was born in England circa 1939 to Major Ian Maitland Pelham Burn and Helen Pamela Rowlatt, and great-grandson to Henry Pelham Burn of Kolkata, West Bengal, India. He flew to the United States in September 1957 to return a Mughal-era sword-- acquired by his great grandfather in 1857 at the Siege of Delhi-- to the Indian representation at the Moral Re-Armament movement hub on Mackinac Island, Michigan. He became involved with the movement, working in Michigan and the US South, for nearly five years before returning to England.</p>  </bioghist>
